<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<br>
If you use IBM Security Identity Manager to manage user accounts,  you
can use the self-care application to enable users to be able to manage their own user IDs and
passwords. Enabling users  to perform these types of self-management tasks reduces the
number of help desk calls.
	<p>
		<b>NOTE:</b> This self-care application is different than the Self
		Service application that comes with IBM Security Identity Manager. This
		example demonstrates how to write your own
		self-care web application by using IBM Security Identity Manager public APIs. This example is for the demonstration purpose only. The self-care  example application supports the following operations:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Change your  password</li>
	<li>Change your  personal information</li>
	<li>Change your challenge response answers</li>
	<li>Register yourself as a new user</li>
	<li>Reset your password by answering the challenge response questions</li>
	</ul><p>
	</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Build"></a>Building the Self-Care Application</h2>
<br>
Use the build scripts in the examples directory to
create <b>itim_expi.war</b> file.
See <a href="../Building.html">Building the Examples</a> for more details
on how to build the examples.  To build only the self-care application,
specify <code>self_care</code> as the target when building the examples.
For example, issuing the &quot;<i>build self_care</i>&quot; command on
Windows operating systems, or the &quot;<i>./build.sh self_care</i>&quot; command on UNIX operating systems,
 creates the <b>itim_expi.war</b> file. The administrator installs this war
 file onto WebSphere Application Server by following
these <a href="#WASInstall">instructions</a>. If the administrator makes
any changes to the source of the self-care application, the administrator
must recreate <DFN>itim_expi.war file</DFN>.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="WASInstall"></a>Installing the Self-Care Application on WebSphere</h2>
<br>
Before you install the self-care application, be familiar with
the requirements for installing it and the methods of
installation.
<br>
<br>
You must install the self-care application on a system that has
WebSphere Application Server  already installed. You must
also have installed the WebSphere Application Server patches that are specified
in the IBM Security Identity Manager Release Notes. Use the installation
intructions in the Release Notes to install the patches.
<br><h4><a name="WASInstall_Methods_1"></a>Installing on a system
where IBM Security Identity Manager is installed</h4>
<br>
<P>Follow these steps  to install the self-care application on a
WebSphere Application Server that has IBM Security Identity Manager
installed:</P>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Build">Build</a> the self-care
	application to create the <b>itim_expi.war</b> file.</li>
	<li>Log on to the WebSphere administrative console (for example.,
	http://localhost:9060/ibm/console).</li>

	class loader for application</b> for WAR class loader policy.</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b>   to apply the changes.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Save</b> to save the changes to the master
	configuration.</li>
	<li><b></b>Do not start the self-care application until after you have
	followed the remaining steps, including <a href="#WASSecurityEnabled">Changes
	if WebSphere Java 2 Security is Enabled</a>, <a href="#ConfigApp">Configuring
	the Self-Care Application</a>, and <a href="#ConfigITIM">Configuring
	IBM Security Identity Manager</a>.</li>
	<li>Copy the itim_expi.properties file from the
	<i>$ITIM_HOME/</i>extensions/{<i>RELEASE_VERSION</i>}/examples/self_care
	directory (where <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR> is the directory where IBM Security Identity Manager is installed) to the <i>$WAS_HOME</i>/properties
	directory (where <VAR>$WAS_HOME</VAR> is the directory where
	WebSphere Application Server is installed).</li>
</ul><p>
<p>
<h2><a name="WASSecurityEnabled"></a>Changes if WebSphere Java 2
Security is Enabled</h2>
<b> <br>
</b>If Java 2 security has been enabled for the WebSphere Application Server
where the self-care application has been installed, follow this
procedure:<b></b></p></p>
<UL>
	<LI>Edit the <b>was.policy</b> file in the
	<i>$WAS_HOME</i>/profiles/<i>$PROFILE_NAME</i>/config/cells/<i>$CELL_NAME</i>/applications/itim_expi_war.ear/deployments/itim_expi_war/META-INF directory
	(The <VAR>$WAS_HOME</VAR> is the directory where WebSphere
	Application Server is installed. The <VAR>$PROFILE_NAME</VAR> is the name of
	the WebSphere Application Server profile in which the self-care
	application has been installed. The <var>$CELL_NAME</var> is the name of
	the WebSphere Application Server cell in which the self-care application
	has been installed).</LI>
	<LI>Modify the application permissions in the <b>was.policy</b>
	file as follows:<BR>
	<SAMP>grant codeBase &quot;file:${application}&quot; {<BR>

	};</SAMP></LI>
	<LI>Restart the WebSphere Application Server on the system where
	the self-care application has been installed.</LI>
</UL>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="ConfigApp"></a>Configuring the Self-Care Application</h2>
</p>
 Edit the <b>itim_expi.properties</b> file in the <i>$WAS_HOME</i>/properties directory (where <var>$WAS_HOME</var> is
the directory where WebSphere Application Server is installed on the
system where the self-care application is installed), and set the following
key properties:
<br>
<br>
Tenant and Tenant DN setup:
<br>
<samp>tenantid=&lt;your tenant ID&gt;<br>
tenantdn=&lt;your tenant DN&gt;</samp>
<br>
<br>
Default organization (root in  Identity Manager):
<br>
<samp>default.org=root organization in IBM Security Identity Manager<br>
platform.url=iiop://host name of IBM Security Identity Manager server:port<br>
</samp>
(URL where  Identity Manager is installed)
<br>
<br>
<samp>platform.principal=EJB user name (default=
&quot;rasweb&quot;)<br>
platform.credentials=EJB user credentials (default = &lt;blank&gt;)</samp>
<br>
<br>
You can determine the values for these properties by looking at the
corresponding values in the <b>enRole.properties</b> file.  This file is
located in the <i>$ITIM_HOME</i>/data/ directory
(where <var>$ITIM_HOME</var> is the directory where IBM Security Identity Manager
is installed). The properties and corresponding values are described in the
following table.

<b> </b>Log on to the  Identity Manager administrative console and
follow these steps  to configure Identity Manager: 
<ul>
	<li>Create a Location in the  IBM Security Identity Manager organization
	structure for the self-registered users. By default,
	the self-care application uses the Location <b>selfregisterhere</b>.
	You can specify any name but you must update the self-care application  to recognize the name. <br>
	<br>
	If you create a non-default Location name, edit the <b>itim_expi.properties</b> 
	file to update the self-care application. This  file is located in  
	<i>$WAS_HOME</i>/properties directory (where <b><var>$WAS_HOME</var></b>
	is the directory where WebSphere Application Server is installed on the
	system where the self-care application is installed), and set the
	following property to the name of the Location: <br>
	<pre>orgContainer.selfregister.location.org=selfregisterhere</pre>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Enable forgotten password authentication using
	administrator-defined questions. For more information see IBM Security Identity Manager Information Center.</li>
